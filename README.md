# Job Scraper

This is goal specific project, suited for personal needs. My wife was looking for a job as a Social Worker and I decided to assist by writing a scraper that would generate a list with relevant jobs in our city.


**I used puppeteer of course,** as it is quite simple to follow the docs along with their examples. Also used easy-pdf-merge which was bit frustrating a bit to figure out small errors since it's a small lib.


## TODO;
- Implement nodemailer to send notification for every new job added to the board. 
- OR.... send a PDF with that day's relevant jobs. It's convinient but less competitive.
